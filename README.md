 🏎 **Predictive Tyre Strategy Analysis for Formula 1 & Sim Racers**

A data-driven project built for the motorsport community—empowering sim racers, engineers, and F1 fans with actionable tyre insights derived from real Formula 1 data (sourced from Kaggle). The project leverages Python for preprocessing and Power BI for advanced race visualizations.
 
🔧 **Project Objective**

To optimize **tyre strategy decisions** by analyzing real-world F1 telemetry, pit data, and stint evolution. This project uncovers how tyre compounds behave over race stints, how lap times evolve, and when pit stops make strategic sense. Specifically tailored for **sim racing strategy and race engineering education**.
